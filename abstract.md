NANCYFX - ASP.NET'S Super-Duper-Happy Framework
===============================================

Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based
services (and websites) on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is
to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a
super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.

This means that everything in Nancy is setup to have sensible defaults
and conventions, instead of making you jump through hoops and go through
configuration hell just to get up and running. With Nancy you can go
from zero to website in a matter of minutes. Literally.

Easy doesn't mean it isn't powerful. Nancy is a modern framework. Almost
all of Nancy is extensible and employs powerful techniques like IOC
Containers, Async and Dynamics. It may be light-weight, but it's
certainly no light-weight.

Spend an hour and learn about Nancy. You'll be super-duper-happy you
did!
